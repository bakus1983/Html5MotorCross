HTML5 Motorcross
================

Toy project for Google's HTML5 Hackaton (Aug 11th, 2011, Mountain View: http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1910202467)

The goal was to make a replica of 1997's Action Super Cross game, using Box2d-js, a Javascript Physics engine (http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/)

Completed in 2 hours of collaboration. Later we found a better JS library for the purpose â€“ http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/

Live demo: http://dybskiy.com/bike

Use left/right arrow to accelerate/brake, and up/down to tilt the bike.
